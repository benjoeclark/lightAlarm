lightAlarm is code to explore what is necessary to create a useful light alarm clock. Some ideas for the project include:
* getting progressively brighter (perhaps from the bottom up) as the time to wake up gets closer
* once up and running, display the weather forecast for the day (at least temperature and precipitation probability)
