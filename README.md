lightAlarm is code to explore what is necessary to create a useful light alarm clock. Some ideas for the project include:
* getting progressively brighter (perhaps from the bottom up) as the time to wake up gets closer
* once up and running, display the weather forecast for the day (at least temperature and precipitation probability)

The pixels.py implementation is meant to have similar functionality as the NeoPixel library provided by adafruit.com. More details are in the [Neopixel Uberguide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide)
